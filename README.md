# Lullaby: The Easy Solution to Avoiding Nightmares
This is a template meant to encourage higher code quality and allow for more seamless collaboration between multiple contributors. Know that not all code is my own, in fact, most has been borrowed from a collaborator.

1. Get started by replacing all of the instances of `lullaby` in the repository, including in `Makefile` and `setup.py`. (Tip: With some code editors, changing the folder name will prompt an automatic fix to the dependencies.)
2. Tune the packages to your needs by editing `requirements.txt` as desired.
3. After writing some code, make your code conform to style guides with `make format`. (Note: You need to add any new required packages to `requirements.txt`.)
4. Before pushing, check that there are no type errors and that the linter passes with `make test`.
5. After you complete your module, run it with `make run`.
6. If you forget any of these commands, use `make help` or simply `make`.
7. Lastly, protect yourself from future headaches by adding the `main-guard` ruleset to your repository!
